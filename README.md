# Mixed Language Audiobook Website
The Mixed Language Audiobook Website is designed to help users improve their proficiency in a secondary language by listening to audiobooks in multiple languages while following along with the text simultaneously. Audiobooks are automatically split by sentences and properly aligned to provide users with one sentence in a certain language followed by the corresponding sentence(s) in another language. For the audio splitting functionality, you can view the code in the [language-splitter](https://github.com/victor823543/language_splitter) repository. The current version of the website is published at https://learnlanguageaudio.netlify.app. (Since this is a demo website only one audiobook is currently available)
